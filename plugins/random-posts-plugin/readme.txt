This plugin **requires** the latest version of the *Post-Plugin Library:* [download it now](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/post-plugin-library.zip).

== Installation ==

1. IMPORTANT! If you are upgrading from a previous version first deactivate the plugin, then delete the plugin folder from your server. 

1. Upload the plugin folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder. If you haven't already you should also install the [Post-Plugin Library](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/post-plugin-library/)></a>.

1. Go to the **Plugins** page and activate the plugin.

1. Put `<?php random_posts(); ?>` at the place in your template where you want the list to appear or use the plugin as a widget.
